# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Framework

## Overview

This document implements a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis framework based on methodologies used by major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta.

## RCA Process Framework

### 1. Incident Classification

- **Severity Levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Impact Assessment**: User-facing, Internal, Performance, Security
- **Urgency Matrix**: Time-sensitive vs. Business impact

### 2. Data Collection Phase

- **Timeline Reconstruction**: When did the issue first occur?
- **Scope Assessment**: What systems/components are affected?
- **Evidence Gathering**: Logs, metrics, user reports, code changes
- **Stakeholder Input**: Developer feedback, user complaints, monitoring alerts

### 3. Analysis Techniques

#### 3.1 Five Whys Method

1. Why did the problem occur?
2. Why did that cause happen?
3. Why did that underlying cause happen?
4. Why did that deeper cause happen?
5. Why did that root cause happen?

#### 3.2 Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

- **People**: Skills, training, communication
- **Process**: Procedures, workflows, standards
- **Technology**: Tools, infrastructure, code quality
- **Environment**: External factors, dependencies

#### 3.3 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

- **Potential Failure Modes**: What can go wrong?
- **Effects**: What happens when it fails?
- **Causes**: Why does it fail?
- **Risk Priority Number**: Severity × Occurrence × Detection

### 4. Root Cause Categories

#### 4.1 Technical Causes

- Code defects and bugs
- Architecture limitations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure failures

#### 4.2 Process Causes

- Inadequate testing procedures
- Poor code review practices
- Insufficient documentation
- Lack of monitoring/alerting
- Deployment process issues

#### 4.3 Human Causes

- Knowledge gaps
- Communication failures
- Inadequate training
- Time pressure
- Assumption errors

### 5. Corrective Actions Framework

#### 5.1 Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)

- Stop the bleeding
- Implement workarounds
- Communicate to stakeholders
- Preserve evidence

#### 5.2 Short-term Actions (1-7 days)

- Fix the immediate cause
- Implement monitoring
- Update documentation
- Conduct team review

#### 5.3 Long-term Actions (1-4 weeks)

- Address systemic issues
- Improve processes
- Enhance tooling
- Training and education

### 6. Prevention Strategies

#### 6.1 Proactive Measures

- Code quality gates
- Automated testing
- Continuous monitoring
- Regular security audits
- Performance benchmarking

#### 6.2 Reactive Improvements

- Incident response procedures
- Escalation protocols
- Communication templates
- Post-mortem processes
- Knowledge sharing sessions

## Implementation Guidelines

### RCA Team Composition

- **Incident Commander**: Overall coordination
- **Technical Lead**: Deep technical analysis
- **Process Owner**: Process and procedure review
- **Subject Matter Expert**: Domain-specific knowledge
- **Stakeholder Representative**: Business impact assessment

### Documentation Standards

- **Incident Report**: What happened, when, impact
- **Timeline**: Chronological sequence of events
- **Analysis Summary**: Root causes identified
- **Action Items**: Who, what, when for each corrective action
- **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways and improvements

### Success Metrics

- **Time to Resolution**: How quickly issues are resolved
- **Recurrence Rate**: How often similar issues repeat
- **Detection Time**: How quickly issues are identified
- **Customer Impact**: Scope and duration of user impact
- **Process Improvement**: Measurable enhancements to procedures

## Tools and Technologies

### Monitoring and Observability

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Real-time alerting systems
- Distributed tracing
- Error tracking and reporting

### Analysis Tools

- Statistical analysis software
- Visualization tools for data analysis
- Collaboration platforms for team coordination
- Documentation and knowledge management systems
- Automated testing and quality assurance tools

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly RCA effectiveness assessment
- Quarterly process improvement sessions
- Annual framework evaluation and updates
- Cross-team knowledge sharing meetings

### Feedback Loops

- Post-incident surveys
- Team retrospectives
- Customer feedback integration
- Metrics-driven improvements
- Best practice documentation

This framework ensures systematic identification, analysis, and resolution of issues while building organizational resilience and preventing future occurrences.
