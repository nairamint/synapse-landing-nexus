## 📝 **Document Update History**

### **Version 3.1 (January 30, 2025) - Critical Issues Assessment**

**Critical Updates:**

- 🚨 **Build System Issues**: Missing dependencies causing build failures
- 🚨 **Testing Infrastructure**: 47 test suites failing due to configuration problems
- 🚨 **Production Readiness**: Missing monitoring and deployment pipeline
- 🚨 **Security Vulnerabilities**: 1 high severity vulnerability detected
- ✅ **AI Integration**: OpenRouter with Qwen3_235B_A22B operational
- ✅ **Core Features**: SFDR classification and document processing functional

**Immediate Action Required:**
