- **Primary Categories**:
  - Formatting inconsistencies (trailing spaces, comma usage)
  - Magic numbers in validation logic
  - Missing end-of-file newlines
  - Inconsistent code style

## Root Cause Analysis Results

### Primary Root Causes Identified

1. **Lack of Automated Code Formatting** <mcreference link="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/tip/How-to-handle-root-cause-analysis-of-software-defects" index="0">0</mcreference>
   - No Prettier integration
   - Inconsistent IDE configurations
   - Manual formatting leading to errors

2. **Missing Development Standards** <mcreference link="https://teamhub.com/blog/understanding-root-cause-analysis-rca-in-software-development/" index="1">1</mcreference>
   - No documented coding guidelines
   - Lack of pre-commit quality gates
   - Inconsistent constant management

3. **Inadequate Quality Enforcement** <mcreference link="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/root-cause-analysis.html" index="2">2</mcreference>
   - No automated quality checks in workflow
   - Missing team alignment on standards
   - Reactive rather than proactive quality management
