## 🚨 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **Technical Debt**

- ❌ Don't skip tests to meet deadlines
- ❌ Don't bypass code review for "urgent" fixes
- ❌ Don't hardcode secrets "temporarily"
- ❌ Don't skip documentation for "obvious" code

### **Security**

- ❌ Don't commit secrets to version control
- ❌ Don't skip security reviews for "internal" features
- ❌ Don't disable security features for convenience
- ❌ Don't ignore security scan warnings

### **Compliance**

- ❌ Don't implement features without compliance review
- ❌ Don't skip audit logging for "non-critical" actions
- ❌ Don't bypass data protection measures
- ❌ Don't ignore regulatory requirements
