## [Unreleased]

### Project Review and Initial Fixes - YYYY-MM-DD

**Mission:** Comprehensive codebase review to identify errors and areas for improvement, followed by implementation of critical and high-priority fixes to enhance stability, functionality, and user experience.

### Review Findings Summary

This review identified several areas for improvement, categorized by severity:

**Critical Issues Found:**
- Potential runtime error in Login/Register pages due to incorrect React Hook usage.
- `MobileCharts` component in HeroSection was not visible on any screen size due to incorrect CSS classes.
- Broken internal link to `/resources/webinars` in the site Footer.

**High Priority Issues Found:**
- Missing dependencies: `styled-components` and `resend`.
- Type safety concerns due to usage of `any` in several components (e.g., error handling, complex props).
- Placeholder links (non-functional `#` links) for "Forgot Password" in Login and "Terms/Privacy" in Register page.
- Generic `alt="User"` text for avatar in `DashboardHeader`, impacting accessibility.

**Medium Priority Issues Found:**
- Potentially unused dependencies initially flagged by `depcheck` (later verified, `tailwindcss-animate` is in use).
- Minor ESLint violations (`exhaustive-deps`, `prefer-const`, `no-empty-object-type`).
- Inconsistent form validation methods (Zod vs. basic HTML `required`).
- Basic HTML rendering for blog content via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` could be more robust and semantically rich.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature in blog uses basic browser API with variable quality.
- Error handling in some authentication flows could provide more user-facing feedback.

**Low Priority/Considerations Found:**
- Opportunity for more consistent responsive font sizing.
- Ensuring all pages use main semantic landmarks like `<main>`.
- Future performance optimization opportunities (image optimization, bundle size analysis).

### Implemented Fixes and Improvements

#### Fixed
- **Critical Rendering Issue:** Corrected Tailwind CSS classes for the `MobileCharts` component in `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` (was `hidden md:hidden`, now `md:hidden`) to ensure it is visible on mobile screens and hidden on medium screens and larger.
- **Critical Hook Usage:** Refactored `src/pages/Login.tsx` and `src/pages/Register.tsx` to ensure all React Hooks are called at the top level. Navigation logic dependent on `isAuthenticated` is now correctly handled within a `useEffect` hook, preventing potential runtime errors.
- **Broken Link:** Removed the non-functional link to `/resources/webinars` from the "Resources" section in `src/components/Footer.tsx`.
- **Placeholder Links:**
    - Updated "Forgot your password?" link in `src/pages/Login.tsx` to point to `/forgot-password` (actual page/functionality to be implemented later).
    - Updated "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" links in `src/pages/Register.tsx` to point to the correct `/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy` pages.
- **ESLint Issues (`prefer-const` and `exhaustive-deps`):**
    - In `src/components/blog/BlogArticleDetails.tsx`:
        - Changed `let article` to `const article`.
        - Changed `let utterance` to `const utterance`.
        - Updated the `useEffect` dependency array for the audio player to `[article.id, article.content, audio, volume]` to satisfy `exhaustive-deps` and prevent potential stale closures.
    *(Note: These ESLint fixes were reported by the worker as already present in the codebase during the fix execution phase.)*

#### Added
- **Missing Dependencies:** Added `styled-components` (version `^5.3.0`) and `resend` (version `^2.0.0`) to the `dependencies` section in `package.json` to ensure proper functionality of styles and Supabase email functions.

#### Changed
- **Accessibility (Avatar Alt Text):** Improved avatar accessibility in `src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` by changing the `alt` text from a generic "User" to "User avatar".
- **Type Safety (`no-explicit-any`):**
    - In `src/components/InviteDialog.tsx`, `src/components/WaitlistForm.tsx`, and `supabase/functions/send-invitation/index.ts`: Changed `catch (error: any)` blocks to use `error: unknown` with appropriate type checking before accessing `error.message`, enhancing type safety in error handling.
    - In `src/components/SEO/SeoHead.tsx`: Updated the `structuredData` prop type within `SeoHeadProps` to use more specific interfaces (`BaseStructuredData`, `OrganizationData`, `ApplicationData`) instead of `Record<string, any>`, improving type definition for SEO structured data.
    *(Note: These type safety improvements were reported by the worker as already present in the codebase during the fix execution phase.)*

#### Investigated
- **Unused Dependencies:** Verified that `tailwindcss-animate`, initially flagged by `depcheck` as unused, is indeed used via `tailwind.config.ts`. No dependencies were removed as a result of this investigation. Other devDependencies (`@tailwindcss/typography`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `typescript`) were deemed necessary.

### Current Project Status
The implemented fixes have addressed several critical and high-priority issues, leading to improvements in application stability (e.g., React Hook rule adherence), functionality (e.g., `MobileCharts` visibility, link corrections, missing dependencies), and accessibility (e.g., avatar alt text). Type safety has also been enhanced in key areas.

While this pass focused on immediate corrections, the initial review also highlighted areas for future consideration, such as:
- Consistent use of Zod for all form validations.
- Enhancing the robustness of blog content rendering (currently using basic HTML conversion).
- Improving the Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature for better quality and consistency.
- Broader application of responsive font sizing and ensuring all pages use main semantic landmarks.
- Full implementation of the "Forgot Password" functionality.

These items can be prioritized for future development cycles. The codebase is now in a more stable state following these initial fixes.
