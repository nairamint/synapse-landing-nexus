# SFDR Compliance UAT Testing Framework

## Overview

This User Acceptance Testing (UAT) framework is designed to validate the SFDR Navigator's compliance with Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requirements. It follows a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach to ensure that all stakeholders, including compliance officers, fund managers, and regulatory experts, can understand and contribute to the testing process.

## Framework Structure

1. **Test Scenarios**: Written in Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then) to describe expected behaviors
2. **Test Data**: Sample fund profiles for Article 6, 8, and 9 classifications
3. **Validation Criteria**: Specific compliance requirements for each SFDR article
4. **Test Execution**: Automated and manual testing procedures
5. **Reporting**: Standardized reporting format for compliance validation

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Article 6 Fund Classification

```gherkin
Feature: Article 6 Fund Classification

  Scenario: Basic Article 6 Fund Validation
    Given I have a fund with minimal ESG integration
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 6"
    And the system should validate sustainability risk integration
    And no compliance issues should be reported

  Scenario: Article 6 Fund with Sustainability Risk Disclosure
    Given I have a fund that considers sustainability risks
    But does not promote ESG characteristics
    And does not have sustainable investment objectives
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 6"
    And the system should validate the sustainability risk disclosure
```

### Article 8 Fund Classification

```gherkin
Feature: Article 8 Fund Classification

  Scenario: ESG-Promoting Fund Validation
    Given I have a fund that promotes environmental or social characteristics
    And the fund considers Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs)
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 8"
    And the system should validate PAI consideration
    And the system should validate taxonomy alignment disclosure

  Scenario: Article 8 Fund with Taxonomy Alignment
    Given I have a fund that promotes environmental characteristics
    And the fund has 25% taxonomy alignment
    And the fund considers mandatory PAI indicators
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 8"
    And the system should validate the taxonomy alignment percentage
    And the system should validate the environmental objectives
```

### Article 9 Fund Classification

```gherkin
Feature: Article 9 Fund Classification

  Scenario: Sustainable Investment Fund Validation
    Given I have a fund with sustainable investment objectives
    And the fund has at least 80% sustainable investments
    And the fund considers all mandatory PAI indicators
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 9"
    And the system should validate the sustainable investment objective
    And the system should validate the minimum sustainable investment percentage

  Scenario: Article 9 Fund with Environmental Focus
    Given I have a fund with environmental sustainability objectives
    And the fund has 60% taxonomy alignment
    And the fund has impact measurement indicators
    When I submit the fund for SFDR classification
    Then the fund should be classified as "Article 9"
    And the system should validate the environmental objectives
    And the system should validate the impact measurement framework
```

### Cross-Cutting Compliance Features

```gherkin
Feature: SFDR Data Quality Validation

  Scenario: Entity Identifier Validation
    Given I have a fund with SFDR classification data
    When I validate the entity identifiers
    Then the system should verify the UUID format of the entity ID
    And the system should verify the ISIN format if provided
    And the system should verify the LEI format if provided

  Scenario: PAI Indicator Validation
    Given I have a fund that considers PAIs
    When I validate the PAI indicators
    Then the system should verify all indicators are from the valid enumeration
    And the system should check for mandatory indicators based on fund classification
```

## UAT Test Execution

### Automated Testing

The following automated tests should be implemented to validate SFDR compliance:

1. **Schema Validation**: Validate fund data against SFDR classification schema
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Validate compliance with specific SFDR requirements
3. **Data Quality**: Validate data formats and consistency
4. **Business Logic**: Validate SFDR-specific business rules

```javascript
// Example automated test for Article 8 validation
async function testArticle8Compliance() {
  const tester = new SynapseQATester();
  await tester.startTest('Article 8 Compliance Test');

  try {
    // Navigate to SFDR Navigator
    await tester.navigateToPage('/sfdr-navigator');

    // Load Article 8 test data
    const article8Data = await fetch('/test/fixtures/article8-esg.json').then(r => r.json());

    // Submit data for classification
    await tester.fillFormWithData('#sfdr-form', article8Data);
    await tester.clickElement('#submit-button');

    // Validate classification result
    const classification = await tester.getElementText('#classification-result');
    tester.assert(classification.includes('Article 8'), 'Fund should be classified as Article 8');

    // Validate PAI consideration
    const paiValidation = await tester.getElementText('#pai-validation');
    tester.assert(paiValidation.includes('Valid'), 'PAI consideration should be valid');

    // Validate taxonomy alignment
    const taxonomyValidation = await tester.getElementText('#taxonomy-validation');
    tester.assert(taxonomyValidation.includes('Valid'), 'Taxonomy alignment should be valid');

    tester.endTest(true);
  } catch (error) {
    tester.endTest(false, error.message);
  }
}
```

### Manual Testing

The following manual tests should be performed by compliance experts:

1. **Regulatory Accuracy**: Verify that the SFDR Navigator provides accurate regulatory guidance
2. **Edge Cases**: Test complex fund structures and cross-border scenarios
3. **User Experience**: Validate that compliance officers can easily use the system

#### Manual Test Checklist

- [ ] Verify SFDR Navigator correctly identifies Article 6, 8, and 9 funds
- [ ] Validate PAI indicator requirements for different fund types
- [ ] Test taxonomy alignment calculation and validation
- [ ] Verify sustainable investment objective validation
- [ ] Test cross-border regulatory scenarios (EU, UK, Switzerland)
- [ ] Validate error messages and compliance warnings

## Test Data

The test framework uses the following test data fixtures:

1. `article6-basic.json`: Basic fund with minimal ESG integration
2. `article8-esg.json`: Fund promoting ESG characteristics
3. `article9-sustainable.json`: Fund with sustainable investment objectives

Additional test data should be created for edge cases and specific compliance scenarios.

## Validation Criteria

### Article 6 Validation

- Sustainability risk disclosure
- No false ESG claims in marketing materials

### Article 8 Validation

- Environmental or social characteristics promotion
- PAI consideration (mandatory indicators)
- Taxonomy alignment disclosure
- ESG integration in investment process

### Article 9 Validation

- Sustainable investment objective
- Minimum 80% sustainable investments
- Comprehensive PAI consideration
- Impact measurement framework
- Taxonomy alignment for environmental objectives

## Reporting

Test results should be reported in a standardized format that includes:

1. Test scenario description
2. Pass/fail status
3. Compliance issues identified
4. Recommendations for remediation

```javascript
// Example reporting function
function generateSFDRComplianceReport(testResults) {
  const report = {
    testDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    totalTests: testResults.length,
    passedTests: testResults.filter(t => t.passed).length,
    failedTests: testResults.filter(t => !t.passed).length,
    complianceIssues: testResults.flatMap(t => t.issues || []),
    recommendations: testResults.flatMap(t => t.recommendations || [])
  };

  console.log('SFDR Compliance Report');
  console.log('=====================');
  console.log(`Test Date: ${report.testDate}`);
  console.log(`Total Tests: ${report.totalTests}`);
  console.log(`Passed: ${report.passedTests}`);
  console.log(`Failed: ${report.failedTests}`);
  console.log(`Compliance Rate: ${((report.passedTests / report.totalTests) * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);

  if (report.complianceIssues.length > 0) {
    console.log('\nCompliance Issues:');
    report.complianceIssues.forEach(issue => {
      console.log(`- ${issue.severity}: ${issue.description}`);
    });
  }

  if (report.recommendations.length > 0) {
    console.log('\nRecommendations:');
    report.recommendations.forEach(rec => {
      console.log(`- ${rec}`);
    });
  }

  return report;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Implement BDD test scenarios and automate basic compliance tests
2. **Phase 2**: Develop comprehensive test data for all SFDR articles and edge cases
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for continuous compliance validation
4. **Phase 4**: Implement compliance reporting dashboard

## Success Criteria

The UAT testing framework will be considered successful if:

1. All test scenarios pass with at least 95% success rate
2. Compliance experts validate the accuracy of SFDR classifications
3. The system correctly identifies and reports compliance issues
4. The framework can be maintained and extended as regulatory requirements evolve
