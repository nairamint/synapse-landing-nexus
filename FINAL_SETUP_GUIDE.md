## 🔑 **STEP 1: CONFIGURE VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

### **Access Vercel Dashboard**

**Click here:** https://vercel.com/aas-projects-66c93685/nexus/settings/environment-variables

### **Add These Exact Environment Variables:**

#### 🧠 **Primary OpenRouter Key (Qwen3_235B_A22B)**

```
Variable Name: QWEN_API_KEY
Value: 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
Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```

#### 🔄 **Fallback OpenRouter Key (gpt-oss-20b)**

```
Variable Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: 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
Environments: ✅ Production ✅ Preview ✅ Development
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Set **ALL THREE ENVIRONMENTS** (Production, Preview, Development)
