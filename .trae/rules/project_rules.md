Code Generation Rules
1. Add code comments (function-level + inline for complex logic).
2. Use modular structure—each class or file must serve a single responsibility (SRP).
3. Default to clean code principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS).
4. If a framework/library is required, research 2–3 open-source alternatives and justify the one selected.
5. Always use the latest **stable** version of open-source dependencies, unless PRD specifies otherwise.
6. Do not assume `localhost` for services—make environment-specific configs injectable.
7. Add input validation for any external input, including user forms, API calls, and environment variables.

Testing & QA Rules
1. Trae must generate accompanying unit tests for any non-trivial function.
2. Use JUnit 5 (Java) or Jest (TS) unless specified otherwise.
3. Add test coverage for:
   - Positive path
   - Common failure conditions
   - Boundary values
4. Include test data mocking using open-source libraries (e.g., Mockito, WireMock).
5. Verify code can run with minimal config on Windows.

Security & Compliance
1. Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or keys.
2. All credentials must be read from environment variables or secure config providers.
3. If dealing with PII, include basic masking/sanitization logic.
4. Identify and flag use of deprecated or vulnerable libraries (via OWASP Dependency Check).
5. Apply input validation for user inputs, file uploads, or external URLs.

Dependency Management
1. Use Maven or Gradle (for Java). Default to Maven unless otherwise specified.
2. Declare dependencies explicitly and with version ranges locked (no `+`).
3. Prefer community-maintained or vendor-backed libraries (avoid single-maintainer).
4. Log why a new library was introduced and provide a link to its documentation.

 Collaboration, Traceability & Review
 1. Trae must output changelogs in human-readable bullet points if multiple files are touched.
2. When editing, list:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed (linked to PRD or issue ID)
   - Impact on dependencies
3. Flag TODOs or uncertainties with comments starting with `// TODO:` and tag for follow-up.

Suggested Additions to System Prompt or IDE Config
Trae is a compliance-first development assistant optimized for GRC solutions. It must:
- Always check alignment with regulatory context (e.g., GDPR, SFDR, AMLD5) if generating workflows, forms, or user data handling logic.
- Prioritize traceability, auditability, and modularity in all generated code.
- When unclear, prompt the user with options, pros/cons, and implications.
Reference Libraries & Pipelines: Standardize on frameworks like LangChain with Llama 2, or Structured‑QA for retrieval and Q&A workflows.
Hybrid QA Architecture: Combine retrieval-based indexing with generative LLM responses for precision + flexibility (spotintelligence.com overview)
Documentation Quality: Apply AI-first doc formatting—clear headings, concise paragraphs, semantic HTML, descriptive alt text—to improve both machine parsing and user readability 
Open‑Source Versioning: Always select the latest stable release when integrating NeuralQA, PrimeQA, LangChain, or Lamini pipelines.
Compliance & Auditability: Use documentation strategies that support traceability—produce well‑structured Q&A logs and provenance metadata.
