# Security Documentation for Synapse Landing Nexus

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Synapse Landing Nexus application to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Protected Routes**: All authenticated routes are protected using the `ProtectedRoute` component, which redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely with proper expiration times and refresh mechanisms.
- **Remember Me Functionality**: Implemented with secure token storage and appropriate expiration times.

### Data Protection

- **Secure Storage**: All sensitive data stored in localStorage is encrypted using AES encryption.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are validated against strong password requirements:
  - Minimum length of 8 characters
  - Requires uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Requires numbers
  - Requires special characters
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

### CSRF Protection

- **CSRF Tokens**: Implemented for all form submissions to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Token Validation**: Tokens are validated on both client and server sides.

### Password Reset Flow

- **Secure Tokens**: Password reset links use secure, time-limited tokens.
- **Email Verification**: Password reset requires email verification.
- **Rate Limiting**: Password reset attempts are rate-limited to prevent abuse.

## Security Utilities

### SecurityUtils

The `SecurityUtils` module provides various security functions:

- `secureStore`: Encrypts and decrypts data stored in localStorage
- `generateCsrfToken`: Generates CSRF tokens for form submissions
- `validateCsrfToken`: Validates CSRF tokens
- `validatePasswordStrength`: Validates password strength
- `sanitizeInput`: Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks
- `generateSecureToken`: Generates secure random tokens
- `isTokenExpired`: Checks if a token is expired

### ValidationUtils

The `ValidationUtils` module provides validation schemas for forms:

- `loginSchema`: Validates login form inputs
- `registerSchema`: Validates registration form inputs
- `profileSchema`: Validates profile form inputs
- `passwordResetRequestSchema`: Validates password reset request form inputs
- `passwordResetSchema`: Validates password reset form inputs

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to what they need
3. **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default
4. **Fail Securely**: System fails in a secure state
5. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing

## Security Configuration

Security settings are centralized in the `SECURITY_CONFIG` object in `security.ts`:

```typescript
export const SECURITY_CONFIG = {
  // Token settings
  token: {
    expiryTime: 3600 * 1000, // 1 hour in milliseconds
    refreshExpiryTime: 7 * 24 * 3600 * 1000, // 7 days in milliseconds
    storagePrefix: 'synapse_' // Prefix for all storage keys
  },
  // Password settings
  password: {
    minLength: 8,
    requireUppercase: true,
    requireLowercase: true,
    requireNumber: true,
    requireSpecial: true
  },
  // CSRF protection
  csrf: {
    headerName: 'X-CSRF-Token',
    cookieName: 'synapse-csrf-token'
  },
  // Content Security Policy settings
  csp: {
    enabled: true,
    reportOnly: false
  }
};
```

## Security Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the application.
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies up to date to address security vulnerabilities.
3. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers in the application's HTTP responses.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events.
5. **Security Training**: Provide security training for all developers working on the application.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the application, please report it by sending an email to security@synapse.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by the team.
